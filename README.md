# AlgorPortfolio
This is a repository for my Algorithms Portfolio Assignment.

In this course, I was tasked with choosing the most suitable data structure for storing and 
accessing courses in the math and computer science departments. I selected a binary search tree because
it offered a strong balance between efficiency and access time, while also maintaining the course in 
alpha-numeric order by course number.

One challenge I faced was deciding how to abstract the courses into a class instead of a struct. By
doing this, I gained the flexibility to define and access course-related functions independently of the
binary search tree, allowing for easier code management and greater potential for reusability in
future assignments.

This project has significantly broadened my understanding of data structures. I've learned to consider
how a given design performs at scale by applying Big O analysis to assess best, worst, and average-case
scenarios. Moving forward, I plan to apply these insights to write programs that are not only efficient
but also maintainable and adaptable for future developers. Proper documentation will also be a key focus
to ensure my code is easy to understand and build upon.
